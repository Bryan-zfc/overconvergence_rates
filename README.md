# overconvergence_rates
Algorithms to compute data related to overconvergence rates of overconvergent modular forms, as in COMPUTATIONS ON OVERCONVERGENCE RATES RELATED TO THE
EISENSTEIN FAMILY (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11537).


- aux_functions.m contains the auxiliry functions, including algorithm 1 in the paper (which is not original in any case)
- formal_Katz_valuations contains algorithm 2 in the paper
